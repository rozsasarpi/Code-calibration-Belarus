__Calibration:__
* Eurocode
* steel structures
* ultimate limit states
* Belarus

__Code(s):__ Matlab
<img src = Matlab/figures/compare_distinct_gamma_Q/sym_constant_single.png width = "400")>

__Note(s):__ 
* The codes are not cleaned organized in any serious way (yet?). If you have troubles to follow it, contact me.
* It might happen that that not everything is included to run the codes without error. Drop me an email in this case and I will look after it.
* Required programs and scripts:
	* [custom statistical functions](https://github.com/rozsasarpi/Statistics---Matlab)
	* [FERUM](http://www.ifma.fr/FERUM)
